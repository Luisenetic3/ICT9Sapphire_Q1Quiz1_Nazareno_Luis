    <h1>My favorite animated movie</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Puss in Boots is one of the last animated movies I have watched which was 2 years ago.<br>
    Ever since then I have moved to watching films like Deadpool, the avengers, and etc.<br>
    But this doesnt mean I hate animated films now.<br>
    This animated movie was one of the few animated movies I have actually enjoyed before moving on because of the story and characters of the show.</p> 
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Here are 2 of the characters that I like the most in the film</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Puss in Boots</h2>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRUIic74teCwmZSsFLCdI8tzanxbeIPbUvUlw&s" alt="The main character him self, Puss in Boots">
    <p>This guy if you couldnt tell already is the main character. <br>
    His name is Puss in Boots and hes been on journeys and in the latest film including him (I think so)br
    He has wasted 8 of his lives and now his imagination of death has come to life and hunt him down.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Perrito</h2>

    <p>The reason why I like this character is quite simple</p>
    <li>He is very <em>cute</em></li>
    <li>Stuck around with Puss even though he was told to go <br>away on multiple occasions</li>
    <li>And even bought some time for Puss and Kitty <br>to finish what they have been trying to do the entire time</li>
    <li>He is also sigma </li>

    <br>
    <p>For movie recommendations, I cant really give any since I have moved on from Animated films and im pretty sure <br>
         the movies that I know probably arent allowed to be recommended here.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Thank you for taking your time to look at my essay.</h2>
    <p>Thank you and have a nice day for the rest of your day</p>
